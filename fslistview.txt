fslistview overview
========================

**fslistview** is a file system using FUSE__ that allows to expose
flat list of files in a single virtual directory. Only files are
considered --- directories, links, fifos, etc. are skipped.  If file
name repeat, then some number is appended.

It's possible to mount several lists at once, each list is represented
as subdirectory.  If a file containing list has been changed, then
list is reloaded.

**fslistview** allows limited operations set on real files:

* read content of file
* remove file

File lists
-----------------------------------

Rules:

* each line in file list is a path; special symbol ``~`` (tilde)
  is expanded
* empty lines are skipped
* lines beginning with ``#`` are considered as comments
* paths must be in absolute form
* all relative paths could be converted to absolute 
  if option ``--base-dir`` is set


Invoking
-----------------------------------

Apart of standard FUSE options following options has been
defined.

-b DIR			base directory for **next list**
--base-dir=DIR		long version of -b

-f FILE			file containting list
--file=FILE		long version of -f


These options can be passed as many times as it's needed,
for example:

::

	python fsfilelistview -b /mnt/music -f latest-cd.list -f duplicated-documents.list -b /mnt/data/backups -f old-backups.list mount-point [other FUSE options]

This command will mount three file lists:

* ``latest-cd.list`` [relative paths are set to ``/mnt/music``]
* ``duplicated-documents.list``
* ``old-backups.list`` [reloaded paths are set to ``/mnt/data/backups``]
